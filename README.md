# Caterpillar 🐛

A clean frontend for Parasite - Built with Fresh.

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

## Documentation
All of these routes present in the default Parasite
API work the same in Caterpillar:

> `/t/[id]` - Retrive torrent.
> `/u/[id]` - Retrive torrent.
> `/i/[id]` - Get list of tagged items
> `/s` - Search
> `/u/[id]/` - Get user profile 
>  > `followers` - Accounts that follow user
>  > `following` - Accounts user is following
>  > `likes` - User likes
>  > `outbox` - Posts by user
> `/login` - Login to an account
> `/register` - Register an account
> `/a/` - Admin routes
>  > `delete` - Delete posts
>  > `federate` - Pool/Block instances
>  > `roles` - Modify user roles

For uploading, and updating, things get a little different:

> `upload/`
>  > `torrent` - Upload Torrent
>  > `list`    - Upload list
> `update/`
>  > `t/[id]` - Update torrent
>  > `l/[id]` - Update list

That is all. Settings can be modified in `settings.ts`.
